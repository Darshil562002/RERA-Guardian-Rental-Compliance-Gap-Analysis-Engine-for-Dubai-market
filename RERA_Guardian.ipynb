        "## Abstract\n",
        "This notebook implements an end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution to monitor rental market compliance in Dubai. It simulates a \"Shadow Inflation\" monitoring system that compares market asking rents against a legal baseline (RERA Index).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "*   **Synthetic Data Generation**: Simulates RERA limits, market listings, and social sentiment (Reddit).\n",
        "*   **SQL Data Model**: Uses SQLite to model zones, listings, and compliance indices.\n",
        "*   **NLP Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes tenant sentiment to flag high-risk zones.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A built-in Dash app for compliance heatmaps and a \"Negotiation Cockpit\".\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Run\n",
        "1.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed (run the setup cell).\n",
        "2.  Run all cells sequentially.\n",
        "3.  Interact with the Dash app at the end of the notebook.\n",

This \"Shadow Inflation\" is invisible in official stats but felt acutely by tenants.\n",

        "2.  **For Tenants**: Use the \"Negotiation Cockpit\" to print a compliance report before signing a lease.\n",
        "3.  **For Investors**: Identify undervalued zones (Green) where rents can be legally raised without breaching compliance.\n",
